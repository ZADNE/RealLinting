# RealLinting

This action checks (via clang-tidy) whether a repo adheres to [C++ Core Guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines).

A very few checks are [disabled]((https://github.com/ZADNE/Real/blob/main/.clang-tidy). Other than that, there must be no errors and no warnings reported for the action to succeed.

## Usage

CMake configuration must succeed on the project to be checked and it must [export compile commands](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS.html) for files to be checked.
