# RealLinting

This action checks a repo with clang-tidy. The checked repo is expected to have .clang-tidy file in place. The action, by design, succeeds even if errors or warnings are reported by clang-tidy. Check report file contents to see if the linting was successful.

## Usage

CMake configuration must succeed on the project to be checked and it must [export compile commands](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS.html) for the files to be checked.

```yaml

    # Absolute file path to the compile_commands.json file generated by CMake
    compile-commands-json:
    # The file that will contain errors and warnings reported by clang-tidy (default: ./clang-tidy-report.txt)
